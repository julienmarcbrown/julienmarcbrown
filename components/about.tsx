                    <p className="p-2">My passion for software began at the age of 11 building bots for old school RuneScape by teaching myself Java, C++, and Python</p>
                    <p className="p-2">This passion has grown into how software can drive business growth and provide value.</p>
                    <p className="p-2">In my career I have had the experience and privilege of being engineer #2 at a company to being employee 75K at Facebook. I have also been a part of two successful exits (acquisition).</p>
                    <p className="p-2">Over this time my individual contributions have led to multiple million dollar SaaS product launches, patents, and a greater appreciation and understanding in my technical and business.</p>
                    <p className="p-2">Growing into engineering leadership I have hired, led and grown globally distributed organizations from scratch.</p>
                    <p className="p-2">My success and track record speak to my dedication to my craft, and I remain dedicated to learning and growth.</p>
