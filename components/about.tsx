                        My passion for software began at the age of 11, building bots for the MMORPG RuneScape (old school version).
                        This passion has grown into how software can drive business growth and provide value.
                        In my career, I have had the experience and privilege of being engineer #2 at a company and being employee 75K at Facebook. I have also been a part of two successful exits (acquisitions).
                        Over this time, my contributions have led to multiple million-dollar SaaS product launches, patents, and a greater appreciation and understanding of various technical areas, industries, and businesses.
                        Growing into engineering leadership, I have hired, led, and developed globally distributed organizations from the ground up.
                        My success and track record shows my dedication to my craft, and I remain dedicated to learning and growth.</p>
